# SocialKB
SocialKB is a system for modeling Twitter data and reasoning about the data for discovering malicious content and suspicious users.

SocialKB uses Markov logic networks (MLNs) for modeling and inference. It uses Tuffy as the MLN engine. Tuffy has been obtained from http://i.stanford.edu/hazy/tuffy/. Please visit this page to download Tuffy.
